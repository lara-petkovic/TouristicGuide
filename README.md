# Schneider Electric Internship Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Schneider Electric Internship Project README. This project represents the work undertaken during the internship at Schneider Electric, involving the development of a .NET and WPF application. The primary goal of the project was to create a server application that retrieves data from a database, managed with Microsoft SQL Server, and presents it using a WPF-based user interface.

## Project Details

### Project Components

This project consists of the following main components:

1. **Server Application**: A .NET server application responsible for connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server database and retrieving data.
2. **Database Management**: The database is managed using Microsoft SQL Server, where the data is stored and can be queried by the server.
3. **WPF User Interface**: A Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application for presenting the data to end-users with an interactive and user-friendly interface.

### Key Features

- **Data Retrieval**: The server application fetches data from the Microsoft SQL Server database, ensuring the latest information is readily available.
- **WPF User Interface**: The WPF application provides a visually appealing and interactive way for users to access and interact with the data.
- **Real-time Updates**: The application may include real-time updates to provide users with the most current information.
- **Data Presentation**: Data retrieved from the database is presented in a user-friendly format, making it easy for users to understand and work with.

### Internship Contribution

During the Schneider Electric Internship, my contributions to this project included:

- Developing the server application in .NET, enabling communication with the database.
- Implementing data retrieval mechanisms to ensure that up-to-date information is obtained.
- Collaborating on the design and implementation of the WPF user interface to provide a smooth user experience.
